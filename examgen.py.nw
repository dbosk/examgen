\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this program is to automatically generate the LaTeX code for an 
exam based on some inputs.
The inputs will be a database of questions, parameters on how to choose 
questions from the database, meta-data about the exam---e.g.~course name, dates 
etc.

The LaTeX code uses the exam \cite{exam} document class.
The idea is to have all exam questions available so that examgen(1) can 
randomly select a number of them and put together the [[questions]] environment 
of the exam document class.

We can also let examgen(1) generate the surrounding code, i.e.~setting document 
class, title etc.~given enough input parameters.

\subsection{Outline}

The program is a Python 3 script, [[<<examgen.py>>]].
We will use the following structure:
<<examgen.py>>=
#!/bin/env python3
<<imports>>
<<classes>>
<<functions>>
def main( argv ):
  <<main body>>
if (__name__ == "__main__"):
  return main( sys.argv )
@ Then we will successively specify what these mean.
The [[<<imports>>]] will contain our imported modules.
For instance, since we use [[sys.argv]] and [[sys.exit]] above we'll need to 
add
<<imports>>=
import sys
@ to [[<<imports>>]].
The code blocks [[<<classes>>]] and [[<<functions>>]] will contain our classes 
and functions, respectively.

The [[<<main body>>]] block contains the code of the main function.
Basically, we need the following code blocks:
<<main body>>=
<<parse command-line arguments>>
<<generate exam>>
<<output result>>
<<clean up and exit>>
@

To parse command-line arguments we will make use of Python's
[[argparse]] \cite{argparse}:
<<parse command-line arguments>>=
argp = argparse.ArgumentParser( description = "Generates an exam." )
@ We also need to add it to our imports:
<<imports>>=
import argparse
@ The parsing step will then be to [[<<parse arguments>>]] and then
[[<<process arguments>>]]:
<<parse command-line arguments>>=
<<parse arguments>>
<<process arguments>>
@
The processing step is rather straight-forward using [[argparse]].
We simply parse [[argv]] and get a Python dictionary containing the variables 
we specify in [[<<parse arguments>>]]:
<<process arguments>>=
args = vars( argp.parse_args(argv[1:]) )
@


\section{Design}

Inevitably, we need to keep the exam questions in some form of database.
Our first option is to reuse the (LaTeX code of) old exams, i.e.~one exam is 
considered one database file.
Thus we need to be able to add several database files, and we must add at least 
one.
We will do that by adding a database argument to the program:
<<parse arguments>>=
argp.add_argument( "-d", "--database", action="append", nargs="+", \
  required=True, help="Adds a questions database to use" )
@ This will give us a Python list containing all the names, so we can read all 
questions in each database:
<<process arguments>>=
questions = set()
for database in args["database"]:
  <<read questions database>>
@ We store the questions in a set since we are not interested in any 
redundancy, the same question should not be added twice even if it occurs in 
two database files.

\subsection{The Questions Database Format}

Since the design allows for using old exams as database files, then we must 
adapt our database format to this.
We know that the exams are using the exam \cite{exam} document class.
As such each question will start with the command \verb'\question' and end at 
the beginning of the next question.
Or in the special case of the last question, it ends with the end of the 
[[questions]] environment.
(See lines 87--290 in the example exam in Sect.~\ref{sec:ExampleExam} for an 
example of a [[questions]] environment.)
We can thus make use of Python's regular expressions facilities \cite{regex}:
<<imports>>=
import re
@ We can use the following code block to set up a regular expression pattern to 
match a question:
<<set up question regex>>=
question_code_pattern = re.compile( \
  "\\\\question(.|\n)*?(?=(\\\\question|\\\\end{questions}))", \
  re.MULTILINE )
@ (See \cite{regex-lookaround} for a treatment of zero-width assertions in 
regular expressions.)
This expression will conveniently also include any parts or solution 
environments used in the question.

To read the questions database we need to do the following:
<<read questions database>>=
<<set up question regex>>
file_contents = open( database, "r" ).read()
<<match a question>>
while ( match ):
  <<parse question>>
  <<remove matching question>>
  <<match a question>>
@ To match a question we simply let
<<match a question>>=
match = re.search( question_code_pattern, file_contents )
@ This makes [[match]] an object of [[MatchObject]] type.
This means that we can use its [[end()]] method to remove the already searched 
text from [[file_contents]]:
<<remove matching question>>=
file_contents = file_contents[match.end():]
@

\subsection{The Question Format}

Now that we know the format of the question databases, this brings us to the 
next part: the format of the actual question and how to do
[[<<parse question>>]].
We need some sort of data structure to hold each question and its related 
meta-data.
One solution is to use a class:
<<classes>>=
class Question:
  <<question constructors>>
  <<question methods>>
@

We will have at least one constructor.
A suitable one is to construct the question from its LaTeX code:
<<question constructors>>=
def __init__( self, code ):
  <<question constructor body>>
@ This LaTeX code is also a natural attribute of the class:
<<question constructor body>>=
self.__code = code
@ We also need a get-method for the code attribute:
<<question methods>>=
def get_code( self ):
  return self.__code
@

To be able to add a question to a set, the data structure must be <hashable>:
<<question methods>>=
def __hash__( self ):
  return hash( self.__code )

def __eq__( self, other ):
  if ( not hasattr( other, "code" ) ):
    return NotImplemented
  return ( self.__code == other.__code )
@ This also means that we are not allowed to modify the question object 
throughout its lifetime, i.e.~the [[code]] attribute must not be modified.

Now that we have everything we need to parse the question, we can thus define
<<parse question>>=
questions.add( Question( match.group() ) )
@ where we add the question to the set of questions.


\section{Randomly Selecting the Questions}

% XXX Add references for how to create an exam
The purpose of this work is to construct an exam, hence there are several 
aspects we need to consider.
The exam should examine if the student has reached the intended learning 
outcomes.
Since we cannot examine every detail of the material treated in the course, the 
exam usually depends on a random sample of the material covering the key 
concepts of the course.
Thus, how we select the questions is of great importance.
Firstly we need to identify similar questions.
This is covered in Sect.~\ref{sec:tags}.
Secondly we need to make a selection which coveres the course in a good way, 
both in topics and in difficulty.
In Sect.~\ref{sec:selection} we describe an algorithm which solves this 
problem.

\subsection{Tags}
\label{sec:tags}

We have handled the problem of the same question reoccurring.
However, we still have the problem of similar questions occurring.
These questions treat the same topic in a similar way and we must recognize 
them as such: we don't want two questions which are too similar in an exam.
One solution is that we mark the questions, using a system similar to tags.
These tags can be used to identify topics, but also be used to mark the 
difficulty level of the question.
Thus it makes sense to have a set of tags as an attribute for our question 
class:
<<question constructor body>>=
self.__tags = set()
@ We also need a method to get this set:
<<question methods>>=
def get_tags( self ):
  return self.__tags
@

To tag a question, we can use the LaTeX [[\label]] command.
Most questions have an attached label, conventionally prefixed with [[q:]].
We can use this convention to add a colon separated list of tags using the 
label command.
(See line 87 in Sect.~\ref{sec:ExampleExam} for an example.)
This list can be extracted using the following regular expression:
<<question constructor body>>=
question_tags_pattern = re.compile( \
  "\\\\label{q:([^}]*)}",
  re.MULTILINE )
@ We can then extract the tags using the first (and only) group in the pattern:
<<question constructor body>>=
self.__tags = set( \
  re.search( question_tags_pattern, self.__code ).group(1).split(":") \
  )
@ This will yield a Python list of tags, which is immediately converted to 
a set.

When we generate an exam, we want to specify which tags we are interested in.
We can do this using an argument on the command-line:
<<parse arguments>>=
argp.add_argument( "-t", "--tags", action="append", nargs="+", \
  help="Adds required question tags" )
@ This will give us a list of tags which we can use when selecting the 
questions for the exam:
<<process arguments>>=
required_tags = set( args["tags"] )
@

\subsection{Handling Topics and Difficulty Levels}
\label{sec:selection}

We now have the set of required tags \(E\) for the exam, [[required_tags]] in 
[[<<process arguments>>]] above.
We also have the set of tags \(Q_i\) for each question \(i\), through the 
[[get_tags()]] method in [[<<question methods>>]].
What we want is a set of questions \(\{ Q_i \}_i\) which cover the exam \(E\), 
i.e.~\(E = \bigcup_i Q_i\).
Since we do not want unnecessarily many questions on the exam, we preferably 
want to find a minimal cover.

We can add both topics and difficulty levels as required tags for the exam.
Thus, with the suggested approach we will cover both topics and all necessary 
difficulty levels.

\subsubsection{Finding a Covering}

To find the covering of the exam \(E\), we will use the following approach:
<<generate exam>>=
exam_questions = set()
<<until the exam is covered>>:
  <<randomly select a question>>
  <<check if the question is good>>
  <<add the question to the exam>>
  <<remove the question so we don't select it again>>
@

Our stop condition requires us to find the set of tags of the currently chosen 
questions (\(\{Q_i\}_i = [[exam_questions]]\)).
We can use the following function to find \(\bigcup_i Q_i\):
<<functions>>=
def tags( questions ):
  T = set()
  for q in questions:
    T.add( q.get_tags() )
  return T
@ Thus our stop condition can be formulated as follows:
<<until the exam is covered>>=
while required_tags != tags( exam_questions )
@

We can randomly select a question by
<<randomly select a question>>=
question = random.choice( questions )
@ and then we can add it to the exam by
<<add the question to the exam>>=
exam_questions.add( question )
@ Lastly we remove it from the database so we do not select it again:
<<remove the question so we don't select it again>>=
questions.discard( question )
@ The random selection also requires us to add the [[random]] module:
<<imports>>=
import random
@

\subsubsection{Checking if a Question is Good}

The main part of the algorithm is [[<<check if the question is good>>]], and we 
will cover that part now.
We do not want to include questions which cover topics outside the scope of the 
exam, hence the question tags must be a subset of the exam tags, 
i.e.~\(Q_i\subset E\):
<<check if the question is good>>=
if not question.get_tags().issubset( required_tags ):
  <<remove the question so we don't select it again>>
  continue
@
We also want to guarantee that the algorithm progresses towards the stop 
condition.
To accomplish this we require that the intersection \(Q_j \cap \left( \bigcup_i 
Q_i \right)\neq \emptyset\) between a new question \(Q_j\) and the already 
selected questions \(\{ Q_i \}_i\) is not empty.
However, we have a special case: if we use an old exam which is not properly 
tagged, then we have questions with an empty tag set.
We must take these into account as well.
Thus we let
<<check if the question is good>>=
elif len( question.get_tags() ) > 0 and \
len( tags( exam_questions ).intersection( question.get_tags() ) ) > 0:
  <<remove the question so we don't select it again>>
  continue
@

\subsection{Human Intervention}

Some of the questions might not be tagged.
Since the selection is randomized, we might want to have some human 
intervention to guarantee a better selection.
Thus we can ask the user for approval for each question.
Since this is a feature we might optionally want, we can add a command-line 
argument to enable it:
<<parse arguments>>=
argp.add_argument( "-i", "--interactive", \
  default=False, action="store_true", \
  help="Turns interactive mode on" )
@

One way to implement the approval is to ask the user to give the tags the 
question satisfies; if none, then the question is discarded.
We can ask for this when we check the question in
[[<<check if the question is good>>]].
So we let
<<check if the question is good>>=
elif args["interactive"]:
  remaining_tags = required_tags.difference( tags( exam_questions ) )
  user_tags = get_tags_from_user( question, remaining_tags )
  if len( user_tags ) == 0:
    <<remove the question so we don't select it again>>
    continue
  else:
    <<set question tags>>
    <<add the question to the exam>>
@ To be able to [[<<set question tags>>]] we need a method for that in the 
[[Question]] class:
<<question methods>>=
def set_tags( self, new_tags ):
  self.__tags = new_tags
@

We use the function [[get_tags_from_user]] to get the set of tags for 
a question from the user.
As hinted above we define the function as follows:
<<functions>>=
def get_tags_from_user( question, remaining_tags ):
  <<get tags from user>>
  return question_tags
@ The reason we need the parameter [[remaining_tags]] is simply for usability, 
to remind the user of what has not yet been covered.
So the body of the function will be
<<get tags from user>>=
<<present the question>>
<<present the remaining tags>>
<<input tags from user>>
@

\subsubsection{Presenting the Question}

We have several options for presenting the question to the user.
First, we can just print the code.
Second, we can prettify the code in some way.
We will use a command-line argument for enabling prettifying of the code:
<<parse arguments>>=
argp.add_argument( "-p", "--prettify", \
  default=False, action="store_true", \
  help="Turns on prettifying of code" )
@ This yields the following:
<<present the question>>=
print( "QUESTION ######################################################" )
if args["prettify"]:
  <<prettify code>>
else:
  print( "%s" % question.get_code() )
@

We can use detex(1) to prettify the code in the terminal.
To do this we use the [[subprocess]] module:
<<imports>>=
import subprocess
@ We then run the question's LaTeX code through the detex(1) process and its 
output will be the prettified code:
<<prettify code>>=
prettified_code = subprocess.check_output( "detex", shell=True, \
  stdin = question.get_code() )
print( "%s" % prettified_code )
@

\subsubsection{Presenting the Tags}

Then we continue with presenting the tags.
We want to present both the remaining tags to achieve a covering and the tags 
for the question:
<<present the remaining tags>>=
print( "TAGS ######################################################" )
print( "Remaining tags: ", end="" )
for t in remaining_tags:
  print( "%s " % t, end="" )
print( "Question tags: ", end="" )
for t in question.get_tags():
  print( "%s " % t, end="" )
@

\subsubsection{Getting User Input}

Once we have presented the user with the data, we want to input the user's 
decision.
We want to make this easy, so any tags the question already has should be 
suggested as default.
For this we will use the [[readline]] module:
<<imports>>=
import readline
@

We want to use [[readline]] to set the default value to the set of tags for the 
question:
<<input tags from user>>=
qtags = ""
for t in question.get_tags():
  qtags += t
readline.set_startup_hook( lambda: readline.insert_text( qtags ) )
@ Then we input the tags from the user, with the tags already pre-entered:
<<input tags from user>>=
try:
  question_tags = input( "Tags: " )
@ And finally we have to reset the default value for the input function:
<<input tags from user>>=
finally:
  readline.set_startup_hook()
@


\section{Generating the Output}

Now that we have all the questions in [[exam_questions]] (see
[[<<generate exam>>]] above), we can move on to the problem of outputting it.
So in this section we define [[<<output result>>]].

The trivial solution is to just print the code for the questions to standard 
out.
Hence we let
<<output result>>=
for q in exam_questions:
  print( "%s" % q.get_code() )
@


\section{Future Work}

There are things that would be worth extending in this solution.
We give a list below, somewhat in order of priority.
(Or order of complexity, so easiest first.)

Since the user tags the questions selected in interactive mode, it would be 
good to save this work.
So these tags from interactive mode should be put into the code.
This way the questions are correctly tagged when the exam is later used as 
a questions database.

The detex(1) utility used to print the question in the terminal removes all 
math-mode code.
This is bad.
Instead of using detex(1), we could use another TeX pretty-printer---one which 
can handle math-mode.
One possibility is using HeVeA\footnote{%
  URL: \url{http://hevea.inria.fr/}.
} combined with lynx(1) or links(1).
Or use tex2mail(1) for math-mode code, then detex(1) for the rest.

We can let examgen(1) generate the code for the entire document, i.e.~preamble, 
title, intro etc.
We can use certain command-line arguments for date, title etc.
The authors of the exam should be the authors of the included questions, 
i.e.~examgen(1) has to generate the authors list.
The alternative is to use the examiner as the author (more editor) and credit 
contributors otherwise.

Another requirement when automatically generating the preamble is to find what 
packages are actually needed.
The required packages can be fetched from their respective questions database.
Although this approach might include some unnecessary packages.

We want to handle inter-question dependence.
Some questions might be follow-ups to previous questions.
This should be detectable by tracing the questions' labels.
If we take this into consideration we do not risk including the follow-up 
question without the first one.
