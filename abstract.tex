This is a general-purpose, simple exam generator for the \LaTeX\ documentclass 
exam~\cite{exam}.
It reads the question database from the source code of old exams, a file with 
questions or teaching material with exercises.
The questions are expected to be either questions from the exam document class, 
i.e.\ start with the
\verb'\question'
macro and end by the start of the next question, or be an exercise environment,
\verb'\begin{exercise}'
and
\verb'\end{exercise}'.

In each question the generator will look for tags:
tags can be used to tag that a question covers a specific topic or intended 
learning outcome (or both).
The set of tags is the union of all tags found in the body of the question.
The tags are used to filter which questions qualify for inclusion in the exam 
to be generated.
Tags are given in questions as comments on the form
\verb'% tags: tag1:...:tagN',
and several such lines are allowed.

The generation algorithm works as follows:
The set of desired tags, \(D\), is specified on the command line.
The set of tags of the generated exam, \(E\), is the union of the set of tags 
for each included question, \(Q_i\).
The union must be equal to the set of desired tags.
Thus \(E = \bigcup_i Q_i\) and \(E = D\) is the condition that must be 
fulfilled.
To achieve this, the algorithm randomly selects a question with tags \(Q_i\), 
if \(Q_i\subseteq E\) or \(Q_i\cap D\neq Q_i\) the question is discarded.
Otherwise the question adds one tag to \(E\) which brings \(E\) closer to 
equality of \(D\).
The algorithm ensures termination by either reaching equality or discarding all
questions in the database.

There is also an alternative interactive mode where each question is opened in 
the user's favourite editor.
When the editor exits the user is asked to accept or reject the question just 
edited.
