Thanks to Martin Kjellqvist, Mid Sweden University, for the ideas of using old 
exams as database files and having an interactive mode.
Thanks to Mitra Damghanian, Mid Sweden University, for the ideas about 
difficulty levels for questions as tags.

A spceical thanks to Lennart Franked, Mid Sweden University, for valuable 
discussions about pedagogy and didactics.
More specifically, the ideas about tagging the exam using the intended learning 
outcomes (ILOs) directly and using the exam generator to generate an exam with 
the ILO a student missed during the first exam are due to discussions with 
Lennart.
